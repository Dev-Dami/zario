# Planned Improvements for dd-tinylog

We are continuously working on enhancing `dd-tinylog` to provide even more robust and flexible logging capabilities. Here are some of the key features and updates we are planning for future releases:

## Upcoming Features

*   **Custom Log Levels**: We plan to introduce the ability for users to define their own custom log levels. This will allow for greater flexibility in categorizing and filtering log messages beyond the standard `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug` levels.
*   **Performance Optimizations**: Ongoing efforts are focused on further reducing overhead and improving log throughput. This includes exploring more efficient ways to handle log processing and transport to ensure `dd-tinylog` remains one of the fastest logging libraries available.
*   **Additional Transports**: We are considering adding more built-in transport options, such as HTTP/S for sending logs to remote servers or cloud logging services, and database transports for persistent storage.
*   **Advanced Filtering and Querying**: Future enhancements may include more sophisticated filtering mechanisms for logs and integrated querying capabilities to help users quickly find specific log entries.

We appreciate your feedback and contributions as we continue to evolve `dd-tinylog`. Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
